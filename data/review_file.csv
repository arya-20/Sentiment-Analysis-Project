"5.0,",Great laptop backpack!," ""I was searching for a sturdy backpack for school that would allow me to carry my laptop as well as schoolbooks. After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers. I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag! Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage. I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane."", ""images"""," ""B001OC5JKY"""," ""AGGZ357AO26RQZVRLGU4D4N52DZQ"""

"5.0,",Love the headphones - great range," ""These are fantastic headphones and I love that i can have my cell phone plugged in at a central location in my house and walk around the house and still listen to music or my book. the range for me is about 30' and the headphones will disconnect if i go outside and then reconnect when i get close to my phone again. If my phone is in my pocket it will stay connected where ever i go. I love listening to things without being attached or tethered to my phone. It also makes it harder for my kids to pull the earphones out of my ears when there is no long cord attached to my phone. I love the 1 click pause feature so i can quickly pause what i am listening to talk to someone (i don't have to go find my phone and swipe and pause). They are comfortable and stay on really well for my ears. I have taken them running and they stayed on as well. I had an issue about 1 year after I bought the headphones and the customer service was wonderful and understanding. really great product and I will continue to purchase and recommend these to my friends."", ""images"""," ""B07BND376H"""," ""AGCI7FAH4GL5FI65HYLKWTMFZ2CQ"""
